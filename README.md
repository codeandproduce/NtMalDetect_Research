# NtMalDetect Research

This is a collection of programs that constitute my Intel International Science and Engineering Fair project. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning approach to dynamically detect malware.

#### The main programs to look out for are the Jupyter Notebook files with the file extension of .ipynb.


The paper for this research can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05412
I wrote a series of posts in my publication on Medium that introduces all the core technologies involved in making this project happen, the last post describing how those concepts came together to make up my project.
This publication can be found [here](https://medium.com/machine-learning-intuition) and the series I'm referring to is the Document Classification series.

This project has allowed us to become Intel ISEF Finalists to compete on May 2018. It also won us the Yale Science and Engineering Award.

## General Overview
This is a general overview of the project:

### System Calls
### Vectorizing Tect
### TF_IDF Values of various N-Grams
### Support Vector Machines Optimized by Gradient Descent
### Results Analysis:
1. Precision & Recall Scores
2. ROC Curve
3. AUROC Score
4. Precision Recall Curve
5. AUC Precision Recall
6. Comparison to other classifiers using different options
